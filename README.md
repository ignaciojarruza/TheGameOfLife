# TheGameOfLife
A recreation of John Horton Conway's Game of Life.
Rules:
1. A cell can either be alive or dead; alive cells will light up, dead cells will remain unlit
2. When a cell is alive, it stays alive if it is surrounded by 2/3 alive cells
3. If a cell is dead, it can only be categorized as alive if it is surrounded by 3 live cells
